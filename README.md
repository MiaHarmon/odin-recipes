Odin Project: Recipe

In this project I plan to make a recipe book for my favorite recipes that I use for dinner. 

Self Reflection: 
I thought this project was pretty nice to do and fun. I ran into a problem when uploading images from my directory because I didn't realize my images folder was accidentally capitalized but it just took some trial and error to realize my mistake. I practiced incorporating images from the web and from my directory as well as figured out how to size them a bit so they weren't as big. The unordered and ordered lists were easy to incorporate and I got to memorize the boilerplate template.
